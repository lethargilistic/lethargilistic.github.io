Michael MacTaggert is a whatever-he-is. Graduated from the University of Washington, Tacoma with a CS degree. Wasn't able to land a good job doing software development. Wasted his 20s on being sad about that and COVID. And now he's interested in copyright law and anarchist theory. He is a staunch plagiarist. Plagiarism is unattributed copying!

He is way too active on Twitter and overshares a lot, so trying the blog thing again is intended to help alleviate that somewhat. Especially since reduced character counts make feelings more opaque as often as they crystalize them.

If it's a diary-ish post, expect it to be a bit sad. If it's a Post-Post meant to be shared, expect it to be inadequate and shared elsewhere.
