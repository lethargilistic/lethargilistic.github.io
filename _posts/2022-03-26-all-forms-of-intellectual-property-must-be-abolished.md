# All forms of intellectual property must be abolished.

All forms of intellectual property must be abolished.

Some will protest that *existential* threats like climate change *must* be bigger problems. Nonetheless, IP is at the nexus of all such problems, telling us which known solutions we cannot use to solve them. Because the regime says we cannot replicate things that work immediately, IP delays our critical work to save people and our planet. It requires a body count to function. In our extreme times where global problems demand global solutions, IP is itself an existential treat.

Our reluctance to admit this is mind-boggling, as the IP concept is both recent and a relic. It corrupts our understanding of both intellect and property.

IP is recent because it has only been systematized for 500 years or so, in contrast to millennia in which people practiced free copying worldwide. All human intellect is based upon copying to learn, experimenting to discover, and sharing discoveries so others can copy to learn. Introducing restrictions here trains us to interrupt a fundamental cycle of the human condition.

IP is a relic because, charitably, it only made sense in a world where the means of production needed to be organized as property concentrated in businesses. That is no longer the case. Where are the means of production today? In everyone's living rooms, shared by computers that can replicate any signal and 3D print any part of anything we could ever want to make. IP is obsoleted by the computer. It is inherently incapable of providing the competitive restrictions that supposedly justified its existence hundreds of years ago.

IP is all-too-high-cost and no-benefit for the modern world . Those costs are delays, deaths, and cultural inertia. If we universally abolished IP, the world would be a better place that very day.
